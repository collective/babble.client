Javascript Unit testing:
========================
We use QUnit_ , the JQuery test runner, for unit tests.

Simply load the index.html file directly in the browser with file:/// to
execute the tests.

A working internet connection is required to run these tests since externally
hosted versions of JQuery, qunit.js and qunit.css are being used.
